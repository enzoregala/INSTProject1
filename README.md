# INSTProject1
## This is a project for INST126 Class
## The objective of the code was to use Python to create a calcuator that takes two variables and performs that operation of choice
## The code ends after one calculation is done so in order to perform another calculation, you must re run the code
## NOTE: the code only uses two different integers
